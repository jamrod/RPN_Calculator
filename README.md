# CLI RPN Calculator
Code chanllenge for Snap Raise

Git Repo [https://github.com/jamrod/RPN_Calculator]

## Requirements
Implement a command-line reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator using a language that you know well.

### Context
We're building this command-line calculator for people who are comfortable with UNIX-like CLI utilities.
We are starting with the basic 4 operators now but will want to eventually implement other operators and
an alternate interface (such as WebSocket, file, or TCP socket).
There's no need to implement these, but design with these future changes in mind.

### Specifications
1. The calculator should use standard input and standard output
2. It should implement the four standard arithmetic operators
3. The calculator should handle errors and recover gracefully
4. The calculator should exit when it receives a `q` command or an end of input
